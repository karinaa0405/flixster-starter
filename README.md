# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

üìù `NOTE` Use this template to initialize the contents of a README.md file for your application. As you work on your assignment over the course of the week, update the required or stretch features lists to indicate which features you have completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`. (üö´ Remove this paragraph before submitting your assignment.)

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I think the labs helped for the most part. I understood how to use useEffect and useState and when. However, I did have to do a lot of researching on my own specifically when implementing the searching and sorting features as they weren't discussed in labs.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would work on stretch features such as the watched and favoriting the movies.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My project demo went well! I was confident and showed all the core features of my website. I noticed that one of my peers implemeted a page incrementer as their load more button, which was super cool and it would be nice to try next time.

### Shout out

I wanna give a shout out to my peer Sydney Brown and my instructor/advisor Devarsh Thaker!!
